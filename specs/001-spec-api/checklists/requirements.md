# Specification Quality Checklist: Stock Data Query Service Specifications

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-24  
**Feature**: [001-spec-api/spec.md](./spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Spec describes WHAT, not HOW
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - Queries, stock discovery, information retrieval
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Plain language, clear scenarios
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - User scenarios, requirements, success criteria, API specs, data specs

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - All requirements are clear
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - Each FR has clear acceptance scenarios
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - Response times (2s), concurrent users (1000), accuracy (95%)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - No frameworks/languages mentioned
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - 5 user stories with detailed scenarios
- [x] Edge cases are identified - Database failures, invalid data, missing data, pagination boundaries
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - Read-only service, specific endpoints, clear limits
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - TimescaleDB, external sync service, environment config

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - Each FR mapped to user story scenarios
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - Query data, list stocks, get info, search, health checks
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - All success criteria are achievable
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - Spec describes business logic, not code structure

## Notes

All checklist items pass. Specification is ready for planning or deployment.
